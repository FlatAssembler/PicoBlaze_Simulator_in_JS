;This is a program to test the
;new features of the preprocessor,
;the `<code>display</code>` directive,
;`<code>if</code>`-`<code>else</code>` branching and
;`<code>while</code>` loops, by
;printing the Fibonacci numbers
;smaller than 100 on the terminal
;during the assembly time.
;This program compiles to no machine
;code at all, and it does nothing except
;causing an error message right after
;assembly (that the assembler written in
;JavaScript sent no machine code to the
;main program written in Java) in
;<a href="https://github.com/FlatAssembler/PicoBlaze_Simulator_for_Android">PicoBlaze Simulator for Android</a>.
;I have started a
;<a href="https://board.flatassembler.net/topic.php?p=232650#232650">forum thread about this program</a>.

;<b style="color: #770000">WARNING</b>: Please do not press
;         "<i>Highlight Assembly</i>"
;         before you assemble this program,
;         as there is a bug in the syntax
;         highlighter inserting a

;         and greater-than characters,
;         causing syntax errors in programs
;         such as this one. I have opened
