;This program has been tested on real
;PicoBlaze and it worked there! While
;this program uses regbanks and flags,
;I would not take the fact that it
;works on PicoBlaze to mean that the
;emulation of flags in this simulator
;is realistic when the regbank changes.
;Namely, given what I know, it is
;possible that real PicoBlaze does not
;have separate flags for each regbank.
;The "Regbanks-Flags Test" is supposed
;to test for that (to succeed if and 
;only if flags work the way I think they
;do when the regbank changes, and to
;fail if they do not).

;Converting binary numbers entered using
;the switches to decimal and displaying
;them on the 7-segment displays.
;Also, converting them to Gray code and
;displaying the Gray code using LEDs.
